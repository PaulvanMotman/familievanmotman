<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C">Branch D:</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C">Jan Casimir Theodorus van Motman</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">Jan Casimir Theodorus died when he was only 46 just like his eldest brother Willem
    (branch A). He was lord of the estate Tjikandi Ilir (Bantam). We do not know much
    about him. In a letter of Willem van der Hucht to his brother Jan he described him
    as “one of his best friends. He is a honest and good man but he has never been in
    Europe, keep this in mind and don’t go by the looks. I go bail for his intrinsic
    merit”. Jan C.Th. lived at that time in Batavia at the Molenvliet next to the inn
    of the widow Stelling (150) where Jan van der Hucht stayed temporarily. </span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">Together with Pieter Holle Jan C.Th. ran the coffee-estate Bolang from 1843 until
    Pieter’s death on August 15th, 1845, Pieter putting in his management and Jan the
    land. Pieter Holle was buried by way of exception at the graveyard of the family
    Van Motman in Djamboe.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">His wife Anna was only 16 when she married Jan and died 10 years later leaving behind
    her six children between two and nine years, that is five daughters and one son.
    Not much is known about </span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">Anna. We know that her father Frits Quentin founded in 1837 together with 53 other
    members of the freemasons’ lodges ‘La Vertueuse’ and ‘La Fidele Sincérité’ the new
    joint lodge ‘De Ster in het Oosten’. He was of German origin (Kassel, Hessen); he
    had besides Anna two other daughters who married into the families Van Gelder and
    Palmer Van Der Broek.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">After the decease of Anna the children were brought to their uncle Jacob and aunt
    Aldonse (branch C) in Dramaga where they grow up and from which place they married.
    With exception of Jans the oldest daughter, all married when they were 20. Jans married
    not until she was 25 probable while she had a task in bringing-up her younger sisters.
    She and her sister Miam married both with sons of Pieter Holle and Alexandrine van
    der Hucht, respectively with Adriaan and Albert. &nbsp;Both sons died relatively young,
    so their wives were early widows and moved to Holland.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">Jans and Adriaan had a son Alex (no offspring) and a daughter Eleonore who married
    first with John Lamberts who died &nbsp;early and nine years later she remarried J.A.
    baron van Heeckeren van Molecaten. The portraits of GWC and Reiniera were in the
    possession of him and his wife and got unfortunately lost when their house De Lange
    Hut in the woods around Arnhem was destroyed by a fire. The son Alex came in the
    news as the Dutch uncle Alex of Simone Arnoux (*1915, † 2001) who married in 1951
    with Aschwin, the brother of the Dutch prince Bernhard (father of queen Beatrix).</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">Alex was not a real uncle but the husband of the aunt of Simone (151).</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">Miam and Albert Holle had four children of whom three daughters who married in the
    Families Krayenhoff, Brewer and Broese van Groenou.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">There was a third sister, Aldonse, who married with a Holle but this Holle was not
    parented to the other family Holle. She got permission to write and call herself
    Quentin Van Motman. The story goes that one of her sons (Louis) wanted to marry a
    foreign princess and to make more impression on that lady he asked his mother to
    change her name. Perhaps the idea occurred to him while his mother-in-law called
    Van Vessem had added the name Van Motman to her name, apart from that for quite another
    reason.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">150 This concerns the Hotel de Provence, property of Isabella Cornelia Lehmann, widow
    of Peter Christiaan Stelling and remarried with Cornelis Denninghoff. &nbsp;Their son
    Friederich Denninghoff Stelling married Alexandrine, the youngest daughter of Peter
    Holle. The Hotel de Provence was renamed in Hotel Rotterdam in 1851 and in Hotel
    des Indes in 1856.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">151 Her first husband was a Watzdorf; from that marriage 2 sons Stephan and Thilo.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">Two sisters left: Wilhelmina married August Verbeek. This marriage lasted only four
    years while August drowned during a military operation in the river Bila in N.E.
    Sumatra. Cato married Gustav Mundt who was appointed to manager of the tea plantation
    Parakan Salak after the death of Adriaan Holle in 1879. In 1885 he was appointed
    to be president of the Soekaboemische Landbouw Vereeniging in succession to Albert
    Holle.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">The only son Casimir didn’t marry but he had two daughters from a relation with the
    inland woman Sariama and a son and a daughter from a relation with the Chinese woman
    Tan Atieh Nio, who were all recognized and legalized. The son Frederik Casimir had
    two daughters and a son named Casimir but his marriage with Ietje Muller was without
    issue.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Standaard-P"><span class="Standaard-C-C0">From a later relation of &nbsp;Jan C.Th. with the Chinese woman Tan Kim Nio another two
    children were born, a daughter Mien who married her nephew Cornelis F.J. (branch
    B3) and a son Jan who grew up at the house of his uncle Piet (branch E) together
    with his later wife Margaretha de Haan. They had two daughters who married into the
    families Luymes and Bennebroek Evertsz and a son Cornelis who married twice and got
    a daughter but no son. Subsequently branch D died out.</span></p>
