<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Branch C:</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Jacob Gerrit Theodoor van Motman</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0"><br><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">Jacob Gerrit &nbsp;Theodoor, the head of this branch, succeeded his father as a country
    lord of Dramaga. Later on Jacob became also owner of the country Djasinga, which
    was as a plantation still uncultivated .</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">His father, Gerrit Willem Casimir had bought Dramaga around 1813. Dramaga was well
    known for its `Liberia-coffee plantations that belonged a long time to the most beautiful
    and most fruit-bearing of Java. Afterwards tea was cultivated, which was also excellent
    until the plantation was hit by a plague of black flies. Finally one changed over
    to plant rubber trees. There has also been a time, that sugar cane was cultivated.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">Cateau Kerkhoven reported on that point to her children in the Netherlands in a letter
    in 1867: </span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C1">“The sugar factory on Dramaga was very interesting, an enormous appliance with enormous
    machineries. There is also a rice-mill but much more simple and it was brought into
    movement not by steam but only by water.”</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">The country house was called “Groot Dramaga” it had as many as 20 extra sleep chambers
    to accommodate guests. As a result of a visit to the country house Cateau wrote&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C1">“The house on Dramaga is splendid, blank marble and white walls all over the place;
    in the front veranda one has a splendid view on the Salak and everything looks very
    cheerful. &nbsp;There is a large swimming pool where the water flows in with an enormous
    jet and it is drained away through an opening on the other side”.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0"> At the time of her visit six nieces of Jacob lived there too: Suze van Kakum just
    arrived with a nanny from the Netherlands and the five daughters of Jan lived there
    already longer. Although she saw Dramaga for the last time in 1884 Anne Edwards,
    13 years old, wrote in a letter addressed in 1948 to her nephew:</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">`I could draw the whole groundplan and architecture or Dramaga blindfold; I remember
    every room so well, and every tree in the garden almost, the boengoer near the big
    bell, the doekoe-trees, the spice-shrubs, the nutmegs at the back, the lovely ferns
    and begonias all round the house in flower-pots and the horses and carriages.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">The piebald horses always excited my admiration and the four ponies harnessed to
    a low kind of phaeton, that raced so fast along the road that the boedjang had hard
    work to rush to their heads when necessary, and captain P. van der Woude of the `prince
    Frederik, when he came to Dramaga with us once, said he felt safer in a storm in
    the Bay of Biscay than in that carriage with four bolting ponies.’</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">And in another letter she writes about new year festivals on Dramaga: </span><span class="Normal-C-C1">“I remember
    so well, when I was 3 or 4 years old, being allowed to stay up till midnight at a
    ball on Dec. 31st &nbsp;at Dramaga and falling asleep in the arms of Betsy Schuurman in
    one of the big rocking-chairs. Then she woke me at midnight to see the Javanese chiefs
    arrive in the dark to the veranda”</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">It is not known where Jacob met his later wife Aldonse van Swieten for the first
    time but Anne Edwards wrote in 1958 in one of her last letters: </span><span class="Normal-C-C1">“I remember that
    when we lived in Batavia (my parents, Mary and I), Grootmama &nbsp;often came to see us.
    If she was alone she `stayed at our home ‘Whitehall `on the Koningsplein. But she
    had a house next door to the Harmonie - the club where balls and concerts took place.
    If she brought visitors from Dramaga with her, aunt Pauline and family, or Mrs van
    Erp and her sons, or someone we were not particularly interested in, Grootmama took
    her logé&#39;s (guests) to the house next the Harmonie, for we already had Edwin, David
    and Jim , my Uncle John sons, living with us, also a governess, first Juffrouw (Miss)
    Knappert, then Juffrouw Knollaart, then Miss Harden”</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">Jacob and his wife were in good repute for their great hospitality. The circumstances
    for a childbirth on Dramaga were presumably much better than on other plantations
    thence several children of other branches were born there. In her book Willem van
    der Hucht Marga C. Kerkhoven writes that the two oldest daughters of Jan Pieter and
    Stansje van der Hucht stayed at Dramaga in 1846 at the invitation of the Van Motmannen
    and &nbsp;were admitted there affectionately. Both girls had dysentery, from which disease
    Constance by name could not &nbsp;recover very good. It is said that &nbsp;the air on Dramaga
    &nbsp;would &nbsp;be good for them. After a stay of about 4 months they were recovered entirely,
    which was &nbsp;also owed to the herbs of a doekoen.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">There is also a story of Charles Walter Kinloch about their hospitality: in 1852
    he and his wife got lost during a walk in the surroundings of Buitenzorg, &nbsp;were received
    hospitable by a Dutchman &nbsp;in ‘Gramagah’ and brought back by carriage and a bottle
    of &nbsp;brandy to their hotel Bellevue in Buitenzorg. It is quite clear who was that
    Dutchman.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">Rosalie was the eldest of their five children of whom two died young. She married
    the Englishman Thomas Pryce of a well known family of British businessmen, who were
    active in Batavia. The married couple left Java in 1884. They moved first to the
    Netherlands and then to Great Britain. Rosalie and Thomas lost a son in world war
    I and two grandchildren in world war II. Their daughters Mary and Anne married both
    a clergyman and kept in touch with the family left behind by letter; we are fortunate
    that the correspondence in question has been preserved to an important extent.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">Constantijn was the eldest son. He lives on in our memory as ‘le tigre de Java’,
    as his fellow students at the Polytechnicum in Zürich called him because of his physical
    strenght, and as the well known country lord of Djasinga. The plantation Djasinga
    was a succes thanks to probably also the fact that both he and his wife Constance
    van Oosterhoudt had been grown up on a plantation.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">According to family papers he got acquainted with her in the house Paneragan 35 at
    Buitenzorg. They had 12 children of whom one died young. The seven daughters married
    into the families Suyck, Zuyderhoff , Still, Schulte, Liebenschutz, Heyl and Van
    Zutphen. </span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">Richard was the only one out of 4 sons who had descendants. Ferdinand did not have
    children of his own &nbsp;but &nbsp;adopted &nbsp;the children of his wife’s sister.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">Pieter, who was two years younger than Constantijn, has been the man who brought
    Dramaga to great prosperity. He was the third of five generations who governed Dramaga.
    </span></p>
<p class="Wp-Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C-C0">It is not known if he got his schooling in Europe as Constantijn did. The changes
    are that he did. He was all for scientific research. He insisted (as other did) that
    the botanist Melchior Treub came to Buitenzorg in 1880 in order to take the management
    of &#39;s Lands Plantentuin. Pieter married Pauline Kleyn. They got four sons, of whom
    one died very young and &nbsp;two &nbsp;only 19 and 27 years old. His fourth son Alphonse married
    Louise de Klerck. They had 2 daughters who married into the families Paauwe and Swart,
    and two sons of whom only the youngest had offspring. His descendants live in Australia.</span></p>
